				<p>After a long and intense judging session that took place over four weeks with three dropouts, Balance Now has been declared as the overall winner in 2018!

Their site was designed by <a href="https://humaan.com/" target="_blank">humaan</a>, and you can read more about them on the winners page.</p>
