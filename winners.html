				<h2>Third Place - <a href="https://stylesourcebook.com.au" target="_blank">Style Sourcebook</a></h2>
				<p>Style Sourcebook is a tool to design and source parts for living areas. It draws the users immediate attention with an interactive header that simulates a 3D environment, and ensures that as soon as you are tired of panning around the virtual room, you have a wide variety of products to look at below, as well as an extensive navigation bar at the top. Whenever you scroll back up from any part of the site, the navigation bar returns to enable you to switch pages quickly. The site makes great use of colors and layouts to highlight the most important parts, and the contrast between dark grey and white at the top helps the rest of the site "pop". There are three different layouts used in the site, one that activates on a large device such as a laptop, one for tablets, and a very compact design for mobile devices. This range of layouts makes sure that all viewers can easily browse the site.</p>
				<p>A key part of Style Sourcebook is the users ability to choose individual pieces that are to their liking and put them together. This is made very easy to do with a design that reflects the level of choice given to users. The menu is massive, and very easy to navigate through to find the specific parts that you want. Style Sourcebook also makes great use of proportion by enlarging some furniture items and text when they are the focus of the page, and keeping everything else very compact to prevent distraction. An example of this is found on the homepage where the menu is tiny compared to the massive header with an interactive room. Overall, Style Sourcebook came 3rd due to its great use of these various design elements.</p>
