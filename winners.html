				<h2>Third Place - <a href="https://stylesourcebook.com.au" target="_blank">Style Sourcebook</a></h2>
				<p>Style Sourcebook is a tool to design and source parts for living areas. It draws the users immediate attention with an interactive header that simulates a 3D environment, and ensures that as soon as you are tired of panning around the virtual room, you have a wide variety of products to look at below, as well as an extensive navigation bar at the top. Whenever you scroll back up from any part of the site, the navigation bar returns to enable you to switch pages quickly. The site makes great use of colors and layouts to highlight the most important parts, and the contrast between dark grey and white at the top helps the rest of the site "pop". There are three different layouts used in the site, one that activates on a large device such as a laptop, one for tablets, and a very compact design for mobile devices. This range of layouts makes sure that all viewers can easily browse the site.</p>
				<p>A key part of Style Sourcebook is the users ability to choose individual pieces that are to their liking and put them together. This is made very easy to do with a design that reflects the level of choice given to users. The menu is massive, and very easy to navigate through to find the specific parts that you want. Style Sourcebook also makes great use of proportion by enlarging some furniture items and text when they are the focus of the page, and keeping everything else very compact to prevent distraction. An example of this is found on the homepage where the menu is tiny compared to the massive header with an interactive room. Overall, Style Sourcebook came 3rd due to its great use of these various design elements.</p>

				<h2>Second Place - <a href="https://carerswa.asn.au" target="_blank">Carers WA</a></h2>
				<p>Carers Australia WA aim to improve the lives of carers in Western Australia. Their website was Designed by <a href="https://bam.com.au" target="_blank">bam</a>, and despite the less flashy design compared to Style Sourcebook, the accessability features and consistant color-scheme helped it rank higher. Carers WA has three layouts for desktops, tablets and phones similar to Style Sourcebook, and the navigation system changes fundementally as the size decreases. Since the site is targeted at an older audience compared to most, it includes a option to increase and decrease the text size throughout the site at the top of every page. This is one of the accessability elements that pushed its ranking all the way up to 2nd place, since it shows the amount of thought that went into the design process. The color scheme is also superb and consistent, using primarily red, blue and white on every page. Even the image on the home page follows the color scheme as the people are wearing blue and white shirts and the other colors fit very well. The navigation is very simple but comprehensive, showcasing over 40 pages throughout the site. Each section in the navigation bar has only one subset of options unlike Style Sourcebook's nested menus, which arguably makes it easier to find what you are looking for.</p>
				<p>The proportions of text and images on the site are well balanced, with the homepage splash text "We're dedicated to improving the lives of Cares in WA" being immediatly visible upon loading the page. The image behind it uses much darker colors in the area where the text is placed, helping to make it pop. Other parts of the site also make great use of proportion, including a section titled "We're stronger in numbers" lower on the home page. The site fills the entire width of the screen on all devices, making sure no space is wasted without sacrificing accessibility. Carers WA is overall a very well thought out site which has their target audience in mind at all times</p>

				<h2>First Place - <a href="https://balancenow.com.au" target="_blank">Balance Now</a></h2>
				<p>Balance now aims to balance genders in Australian workplaces. The design, done by <a href="https://humaan.com" target="_blank">humaan</a>, is very innovative, just like the ideas that they propose throughout their site. The home page features splash text and an image that takes up almost the entire screen - "Fresh bold thinking. Turning talk into action on gender equality" - leaving only a bit of room at the top for a menu. While Carers WA had a vast range of pages, Balance Now only has five despite packing a huge amount of content into the site. This allows for a much cleaner layout which is backed by the stunning design.</p>
				<p>While other sites put all the focus on the home page, the relativly small amount of pages on Balance Now allowed them to pay attention to every one of them. The "How we create change" page uses an interactive graphic with strong colors to draw attention to each step in their process, the "News and Insignts" page is better designed than most sites that are entierly devoted to news, and even the contact page is well crafted, using colors to draw attention to each of the form elements. The proportions throughtout the site suit the content perfectly - a powerful example can be found on the "How we create change" page with "Fresh. Bold. Action" being so much larger than everything else. The site is also very easy to view on devices of any size, with two different layouts for phones and desktops. It dosen't need an intermediate layout since the two cover all sizes between them, which highlights how well thought out the design is. There are a vast number of images on the site, and they are used to draw attention to various text placed on top of them. Overall, Balance Now is an outstanding site that truly deserves its 1st place award.</p>
