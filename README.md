## Planning

I chose these three sites to write about since they were highly ranked on the webawards site, and also because I thought they were well designed and made good use of interactive elements.\


### [Balance Now](https://www.balancenow.com.au/)
Gender balancing in workplaces. Designed by [humaan](https://humaan.com/).

### [Carers Australia WA](https://www.carerswa.asn.au/)
Improving the lives of carers in Western Australia. Designed by [bam](https://www.bam.com.au).

### [Style Sourcebook](https://stylesourcebook.com.au/)
A tool to design and source living areas. Designed internally.\

## Design

Then I designed my site in Sublime Text using HTML & CSS. Currently it only has a home page with some images and placeholder text. You can view it on [GitHub Pages](https://raphydaphy.github.io/WebAwardsAwards) or browse the repository to see the source. I didn't use any WYSIWYG editor or templates although it was recommended in the task, because I wanted to have an additional challenge, and become more familiar with some CSS concepts. This was a success, since I now understand how to use `float` and `clear` as well as put some more simpler things to better use.\

The site isn't very well suited to mobile at the moment, but with some media queries I could easily adjust it to display well on a smaller screen. It looks fine on a tablet or anything larger, though there is a lot of wasted space on either side of the main content which is not ideal.
