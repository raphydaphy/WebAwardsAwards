## Planning

I chose these three sites to write about since they were highly ranked on the webawards site, and also because I thought they were well designed and made good use of interactive elements.\


### [Balance Now](https://www.balancenow.com.au/)
Gender balancing in workplaces. Designed by [humaan](https://humaan.com/).

### [Carers Australia WA](https://www.carerswa.asn.au/)
Improving the lives of carers in Western Australia. Designed by [bam](https://www.bam.com.au).

### [Style Sourcebook](https://stylesourcebook.com.au/)
A tool to design and source living areas. Designed internally.\

## Design

I designed my site in Sublime Text using HTML & CSS. You can view what I have so far on [GitHub Pages](https://raphydaphy.github.io/WebAwardsAwards) or browse the repository to see the source. I didn't use any WYSIWYG editor or templates although it was recommended in the task, because I wanted to have an additional challenge, and become more familiar with some CSS concepts. This was a success, since I now understand how to use `float` and `clear` as well as media queries, the last of which I used to ensure the site is readable on a variety of screen sizes.\

Later in the development I wanted to automatically resize a textarea, but because I didn't know how to do that, I used a script I found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/454202/creating-a-textarea-with-auto-resize" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>. This was the only thing I did create myself, and I only did it to save time since the point of the task was not to create an automaticaly resizing textbox. You can see the result of this on the [Contact Us](https://raphydaphy.github.io/WebAwardsAwards/contact.html) page - the "Message" area in the contact form expands as you write more. Aside from finishing the winners page to include a complete analyzis of each site, everything is finished to a degree I am happy with.
