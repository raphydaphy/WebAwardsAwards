## Planning

I chose these sites to write about..

### [Balance Now](https://www.balancenow.com.au/)
Gender balancing in workplaces. Designed by [humaan](https://humaan.com/).

### [Carers Australia WA](https://www.carerswa.asn.au/)
Improving the lives of carers in Western Australia. Designed by [bam](https://www.bam.com.au).

### [Style Sourcebook](https://stylesourcebook.com.au/)
A tool to design and source living areas. Designed internally.


Then I designed the sites in Sublime Text using just HTML & CSS. You can see the finished site [here](https://raphydaphy.github.io/WebAwardsAwards).
